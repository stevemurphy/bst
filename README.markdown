# Introduction

A collection of BibTeX style files used in the author's current research and writings. This work is not updated very often and is placed in this repository for ease of access rather than for version control.

The files here have various authors, or are the product of software written by various authors. Copyright belongs with those authors. Please contact Stephen Murphy <mailto:stephen.j.murphy@student.uts.edu.au> if you have any concerns about copyright infringement arising from publishing this information.

The inspiration for using git to version BibTeX information comes from Mark Eli Kalderon <mailto:eli@markelikalderon.com>. For more information, see this blog [post](http://markelikalderon.com/blog/2008/06/17/gitting-bibtex/).
